STALIN’S WILLING EXECUTIONERS
JEWS AS A HOSTILE ELITE IN THE USSR

A persistent theme among critics of Jews—particularly those on the 
pre-World War II right—has been that the Bolshevik revolution was a 
Jewish revolution and that the Soviet Union was dominated by Jews. 
This theme appears in a wide range of writings, from Henry Ford’s International 
Jew, to published statements by a long list of British, French, and American 
political figures in the 1920s (Winston Churchill, Woodrow Wilson, and David 
Lloyd George), and, in its most extreme form, by Adolf Hitler, who wrote:
Now begins the last great revolution. By wresting political power 
for himself, the Jew casts off the few remaining shreds of disguise 
he still wears. The democratic plebeian Jew turns into the blood Jew 
and the tyrant of peoples. In a few years he will try to exterminate the 
national pillars of intelligence and, by robbing the peoples of their 
natural spiritual leadership, will make them ripe for the slavish lot of a 
permanent subjugation. The most terrible example of this is Russia
This long tradition stands in sharp contradiction to the official view, 
promulgated by Jewish organizations and almost all contemporary historians, 
that Jews played no special role in Bolshevism and indeed were specifically 
victimized by it. Yuri Slezkine’s book provides a much needed resolution 
to these opposing perspectives. It is an intellectual tour de force, alternately 
muddled and brilliant, courageous and apologetic.
APOLLONIANS AND MERCURIANS
One of the muddled elements, apparent at the beginning and present 
throughout The Jewish Century, is Slezkine’s claim that the peoples of the world 
can be classified into two groups. The successful peoples of the modern world, 

termed Mercurians, are urban, mobile, literate, articulate, and intellectually 
sophisticated. Distinguished by their ability to manipulate symbols, they pursue 
“wealth for the sake of learning, learning for the sake of wealth, and both 
wealth and learning for their own sake” (p. 1). Since Slezkine sees Jews as the 
quintessential Mercurians, he regards modernization as essentially a process 
of everyone becoming Jewish. His second group, which he calls Apollonians, 
is rooted in the land and in traditional agrarian cultures, and prizes physical 
strength and warrior values.
Slezkine conceptualizes Mercurianism as a worldview, and therefore a 
matter of psychological choice, rather than as a set of psychological mechanisms, the most important of which is general intelligence
 As a result of this 
false premise, he exaggerates the similarity among Mercurians, underestimates 
the power of ethnocentrism as a unifying factor in Jewish history, and fails to 
understand the roots of Western social and economic institutions. 
Slezkine views Judaism as one of many Mercurian cultures—peoples that 
dwell alone in Diasporas, living among strangers and often acting as economic 
middlemen: the Overseas Chinese, Indians, and Lebanese, and the Gypsies and 
Irish Travelers. Their common denominator, in Slezkine’s view (and mine3
), is 
their status as strangers to the people they live among—sojourners who, above 
all else, do not intermarry or socialize with the locals. Their interactions with the 
local Apollonians involve “mutual hostility, suspicion and contempt” (p. 20) and 
a sense of superiority. Moreover, a “common host stereotype of the Mercurians is 
that they are devious, acquisitive, greedy, crafty, pushy, and crude” (p. 23). The 
Mercurians possess greater kin solidarity and internal cohesion than the people 
they live among; they are characterized by extended families and patriarchal 
social organization. 

So far, so good, although I would stress that the family organization of such 
groups derives more from the long-term adaptation to the culture areas they 
originate from than from an adaptation to the nomadic, middleman niche
 But 
Slezkine maintains that Mercurians are above all smarter than the people they 
live among: They are said to possess “cunning intelligence,” but it is surely a 
mistake to consider such disparate groups as Jews (or the Overseas Chinese) 
and Gypsies (or the Irish Travelers) as having in common a particular set of 
intellectual traits. After all, the Jews, as Slezkine shows, have repeatedly become 
an academic, intellectual, cultural, and economic elite in Western societies, 
while Gypsies have tended toward illiteracy and are at best an economically 
marginal group. 

Slezkine imagines that the Gypsies and literate middleman groups like the 
Jews or Overseas Chinese differ not in intelligence but only in whether they 
express their intelligence through literacy or an oral culture: “Businessmen, 
diplomats, doctors, and psychotherapists are literate peddlers, heralds, 
healers, and fortune-tellers” (p. 29)—a formulation that will not stand the test 
of current psychometric data. In fact, the general patterns of Gypsies are the

opposite of Jews: a low-investment, low-IQ reproductive style characterized 
by higher fertility, earlier onset of sexual behavior and reproduction, more 
unstable pair bonds, higher rate of single parenting, shorter interval of birth 
spacing, higher infant mortality rate, and higher rate of survival of low birth 
weight infants

 Intelligence, for Slezkine, is a lifestyle choice, rather than a set 
of brain processes underlying information processing and strongly influenced 
by genetic variation. As we shall see, this formulation is very useful to Slezkine 
as he constructs his argument later in the book.
In his attempt to paint with a very broad brush, Slezkine also ignores 
other real differences among the Mercurians, most notably, I would argue, 
the aggressiveness of the Jews compared to the relative passivity of the 
Overseas Chinese. Both the Jews and the Overseas Chinese are highly intelligent and entrepreneurial, but the Overseas Chinese have not formed a hostile 
cultural elite in Southeast Asian countries, where they have chiefly settled, 
and have not been concentrated in media ownership or in the construction 
of culture. We do not read of Chinese cultural movements disseminated in 
the major universities and media outlets that subject the traditional culture of 
Southeast Asians and anti-Chinese sentiment to radical critique, or of Chinese 
organizations campaigning for the removal of native cultural and religious 
symbols from public places

 Slezkine paints Jews as deeply involved in the 
construction of culture and in the politics of the host societies, but the role of 
the Chinese was quite different. The following passage describing the political 
attitudes of the Overseas Chinese in Thailand could never have applied to 
Jews in Western societies since the Enlightenment:
But few seem to know or indeed to care about the restrictions on 
citizenship, nationality rights, and political activities in general, nor 
are these restrictions given much publicity in the Chinese press. This 
merely points up the fact, recognized by all observers, that the overseas 
Chinese are primarily concerned with making a living, or amassing a 
fortune, and thus take only a passive interest in the formal political life 
of the country in which they live

Moreover, Slezkine pictures the middlemen as specializing in “certain 
dangerous, marvelous, and distasteful” (p. 9), but nevertheless indispensable, 
pursuits (p. 36)—a formulation that carries a grain of truth, as in places where 
natives were prohibited from loaning money at interest. However, he ignores, 
or at least fails to spell out, the extent to which Jews have been willing agents 
of exploitative elites, not only in Western societies, but in the Muslim world as 
well

 This is the overarching generalization which one can make about Jewish 
economic behavior over the ages. Their role went far beyond performing tasks 
deemed inappropriate for the natives for religious reasons; rather they were 
often tasks at which natives would be relatively less ruthless in exploiting 
their fellows. This was especially the case in Eastern Europe, where economic

arrangements such as tax farming, estate management, and monopolies on 
retail liquor distribution lasted far longer than in the West:
In this way, the Jewish arendator became the master of life and death 
over the population of entire districts, and having nothing but a shortterm and purely financial interest in the relationship, was faced with 
the irresistible temptation to pare his temporary subjects to the bone. 
On the noble estates he tended to put his relatives and co-religionists 
in charge of the flour-mill, the brewery, and in particular of the lord’s 
taverns where by custom the peasants were obliged to drink. On the 
church estates, he became the collector of all ecclesiastical dues, standing 
by the church door for his payment from tithe-payers, baptized infants, 
newly-weds, and mourners. On the [royal] estates…, he became in effect 
the Crown Agent, farming out the tolls, taxes, and courts, and adorning 
his oppressions with all the dignity of royal authority

Jewish involvement in the Communist elite of the USSR can be seen as a 
variation on an ancient theme in Jewish culture rather than a new one sprung 
from the special circumstances of the Bolshevik Revolution. Rather than being 
the willing agents of exploitative non-Jewish elites who were clearly separated 
from both the Jews and the people they ruled, Jews became an entrenched 
part of an exploitative and oppressive elite in which group boundaries were 
blurred. This blurring of boundaries was aided by four processes, all covered by 
Slezkine: shedding overt Jewish identities in favor of a veneer of international 
socialism in which Jewish identity and ethnic networking were relatively invisible; 
seeking lower-profile positions in order to de-emphasize Jewish preeminence 
(e.g., Trotsky); adopting Slavic names; and engaging in a limited amount of 
intermarriage with non-Jewish elites Indeed, the “plethora of Jewish wives” 
among non-Jewish leaders11 doubtless heightened the Jewish atmosphere of 
the top levels of the Soviet government, given that everyone, especially Stalin, 
appears to have been quite conscious of ethnicity For their part, anti-Semites 
have accused Jews of having “implanted those of their own category as wives and 
husbands for influential figures and officials.”13

By emphasizing the necessity and distastefulness of traditional Jewish 
occupations, Slezkine also ignores the extent to which Jewish competition 
suppressed the formation of a native middle class in Eastern Europe. (This 
has also occurred throughout Southeast Asia, because of competition from 
the Overseas Chinese.) Instead, Slezkine sees Eastern Europeans, through 
stereotypic lenses, as quintessential Apollonians, some of whom became 
Mercurian modernists when forced to by circumstances, rather than as 
containing elements that would have naturally aspired to and competently 
performed the economic and cultural functions that instead came to be 
performed by Jews because of their ability to create ethnic monopolies 
in goods and services. When Jews won the economic competition in early 
modern Poland, the result was that the great majority of Poles were reduced 
to the status of agricultural laborers supervised by Jewish estate managers in

an economy in which trade, manufacturing, and artisanry were in large part 
controlled by Jews On the other hand, in most of Western Europe Jews had 
been expelled in the Middle Ages. As a result, when modernization occurred, 
it was accomplished with an indigenous middle class. If, as in Eastern Europe, 
Jews had won the economic competition in most of these professions, there 
would not have been a non-Jewish middle class in England. Whatever one 
imagines might have been the fortunes and character of England with predominantly Jewish artisans, merchants, and manufacturers, it seems reasonable 
to suppose that the Christian taxpayers of England made a good investment 
in their own future when they agreed to pay King Edward I a massive tax of 
£116,346 in return for expelling two thousand Jews in 1290

While Slezkine’s treatment overemphasizes middlemen as a societal 
necessity rather than as ethnic outsiders competing for scarce resources, he 
does note that the rise of the Jews in the USSR came at the expense of the 
Germans as a Mercurian minority in Russia prior to the Revolution. (Jews 
were excluded from traditional Russia apart from the Pale of Settlement, which 
included Ukraine, Lithuania, Byelorussia, Crimea, and part of Poland.) Germans 
manned the imperial bureaucracy, formed a large percentage of professionals, 
entrepreneurs, and artisans, were more literate than the Russians, and had a 
sense of cultural superiority and ethnic solidarity: 
And so they were, mutatis mutandis, head to the Russian heart, mind 
to the Russian soul, consciousness to Russian spontaneity. They stood 
for calculation, efficiency, and discipline; cleanliness, fastidiousness, 
and sobriety; pushiness, tactlessness, and energy; sentimentality, love of 
family, and unmanliness (or absurdly exaggerated manliness)…. Perhaps 
paradoxically, in light of what would happen in the twentieth century, 
Germans were, occupationally and conceptually, the Jews of ethnic Russia 
(as well as much of Eastern Europe). Or rather, the Russian Germans were 
to Russia what the German Jews were to Germany—only much more so. 
So fundamental were the German Mercurians to Russia’s view of itself 
that both their existence and their complete and abrupt disappearance 
have been routinely taken for granted (pp. 113–114).

Although the replacement of Germans by Jews was well under way by 
the time of the Bolshevik Revolution, a key consequence of the Revolution 
was the substitution of one Mercurian group, the Germans, by another, the 
Jews. The difference between the Jews and the Germans was that the Jews 
had a longstanding visceral antipathy, out of past historical grievances, both 
real and imagined, toward the people and culture they came to administer. 
Indeed, Russians on the nationalist right admired the Germans, at least up to 
World War I. For example, a statute of one nationalist organization, Michael 
the Archangel Russian People’s Union, expressed “particular trust in the 
German population of the Empire,”16 while its leader, Vladimir Purishkevich, 
accused the Jews of “irreconcilable hatred of Russia and everything Russian.”17
Jews disliked the Christian religion of the vast majority of Russians because 

of the antagonistic relationship between Judaism and Christianity over the 
ages; Jews distrusted the peasants, who “fell from grace” (p. 140) with the 
intelligentsia after the numerous anti-Jewish pogroms, especially after 1880; 
and Jews blamed the tsar for not doing enough to keep the peasants in check 
and for imposing the various quotas on Jewish advancement that went into 
place, also beginning in the 1880s—quotas that slowed down but by no means 
halted Jewish overrepresentation in the universities and the professions. In 
this respect, the Germans were far more like the Overseas Chinese, in that 
they became an elite without having an aggressively hostile attitude toward 
the people and culture they administered and dominated economically. Thus 
when Jews achieved power in Russia, it was as a hostile elite with a deep 
sense of historic grievance. As a result, they became willing executioners of 
both the people and cultures they came to rule, including the Germans. 

After the Revolution, not only were the Germans replaced, but there was 
active suppression of any remnants of the older order and their descendants. 
Jews have always shown a tendency to rise because their natural proclivities 
(e.g., high intelligence) and powerful ethnic networking, but here they also 
benefited from “antibourgeois” quotas in educational institutions and other 
forms of discrimination against the middle class and aristocratic elements of 
the old regime that would have provided more competition with Jews. In a 
letter intercepted by the secret police, the father of a student wrote that his 
son and their friends were about to be purged from the university because 
of their class origins. “It is clear that only the Jerusalem academics and the 
Communist Party members generally are going to stay” (p. 243). The bourgeois 
elements from the previous regime, including the ethnic Germans, would have 
no future. Thus the mass murder of peasants and nationalists was combined 
with the systematic exclusion of the previously existing non-Jewish middle 
class. The wife of a Leningrad University professor noted, “in all the institutions, only workers and Israelites are admitted; the life of the intelligentsia is 
very hard” (p. 243). Even at the end of the 1930s, prior to the Russification that 
accompanied World War II, “the Russian Federation…was still doing penance 
for its imperial past while also serving as an example of an ethnicity-free 
society” (p. 276). While all other nationalities, including Jews, were allowed 
and encouraged to keep their ethnic identities, the revolution remained an 
anti-majoritarian movement. 

Slezkine is aware of the biological reality of kinship and ethnicity, but he 
steadfastly pursues a cultural determinist model. He argues that biological 
models of ethnic nepotism are inappropriate because some nomadic groups 
are not kin groups but rather “quasi-families” like the Sicilian mafia (p. 35). 
But this is a distinction without a difference: Why are “natural” kinship groups 
significantly different from groups composed of families that band together? 
Each is characterized by internal cohesion and external strangeness, the traits 
Slezkine deems essential, but there are also kinship connections and a genetic

divide between themselves and surrounding peoples. Cultural badges of group 
membership and a culturally generated ideology of kin-group membership are 
age-old ways of cementing kinship groups and setting up barriers that mark real 
biological differences—the evolved psychology described by modern research 
in social identity theory And in any case, the demonstrable genetic differences 
between Slezkine’s prototypical Mercurians—the Jews, Gypsies, and Overseas 
Chinese—and the surrounding peoples cry out for a biological analysis. 
Moreover, Slezkine underestimates the power of ethnocentrism as a unifying 
factor in Jewish history. This is most apparent in his discussion of Israel, which 
he describes as a radical departure from the Jewish tradition, because Israel is a 
quintessentially Apollonian society. Long after Western societies had rejected 
ethnic nationalism:
Israel continued to live in the European 1930s: only Israel still belonged 
to the eternally young, worshiped athleticism and inarticulateness, celebrated combat and secret police, promoted hiking and scouting, despised 
doubt and introspection, embodied the seamless unity of the chosen, 
and rejected most traits traditionally associated with Jewishness…. After 
two thousand years of living as Mercurians among Apollonians, Jews 
turned into the only Apollonians in a world of Mercurians (or rather, the 
only civilized Apollonians in a world of Mercurians and barbarians)” 
(pp. 327, 328). 

But Israelis certainly did not reject traditional Jewish ethnocentrism and 
sense of peoplehood. Slezkine portrays Israelis as simply choosing to be 
ethnocentric nationalists, but ethnocentrism (like intelligence) is a biological 
system, not a lifestyle choice, and traditional Diaspora Jews were certainly 
deeply and intensely ethnocentric above all else There can be little question 
that Israel and Zionism have been and are promoted and spearheaded by the 
most ethnocentric elements of the Jewish community

For Slezkine, as for so many Jews, the moral debt owed to Jews by Western 
societies justifies the most extreme expressions of Jewish racialism: “The 
rhetoric of ethnic homogeneity and ethnic deportations, tabooed elsewhere in 
the West, is a routine element of Israeli political life…. It is true that no other 
European nation is in a condition of permanent war; it is also true that no other 
European state can have as strong a claim on the West’s moral imagination” 
(pp. 364–365). Slezkine sees the moral taboo on European ethnocentrism, 
the creation of Nazism as the epitome of absolute evil, and the consecration 
of Jews as “the Chosen people of the postwar Western world” (p. 366) as 
simply the inevitable results of the events of World War II (pp. 365–366). In 
fact, however, the creation and maintenance of the culture of the Holocaust 
and the special moral claims of Jews and Israel are the result of Jewish ethnic 
activism. These claims have a specific historical trajectory, they are fueled by 
specific key events, and they are sustained by specific forces For example, 
the Holocaust was not emphasized as a cultural icon until the late 1960s and
early 1970s, when images of the Holocaust were deployed on a large scale in 
popular culture by Jewish activists specifically to rally support for Israel in 
the context of its wars of 1967 and 1973.

Similarly, Slezkine sees the United States as a Jewish promised land precisely 
because it is not defined tribally and “has no state-bearing natives” (p. 369). But 
the recasting of the United States as a “proposition nation” was importantly 
influenced by the triumph of several Jewish intellectual and political movements 
more than it was a natural and inevitable culmination of American history
These movements collectively delegitimized cultural currents of the early 
twentieth century whereby many Americans thought of themselves as members 
of a very successful ethnic group. For example, the immigration restrictionists 
of the 1920s unabashedly asserted the right of European-derived peoples to 
the land they had conquered and settled. Americans of northern European 
descent in the United States thought of themselves as part of a cultural and 
ethnic heritage extending backward in time to the founding of the country, 
and writers like Madison Grant (The Passing of the Great Race) and Lothrop 
Stoddard (The Rising Tide of Color against White World Supremacy) had a large 
public following. At that time both academia and mainstream culture believed 
in the reality of race; that there were important differences between the races, 
including in intelligence and moral character; and that races naturally competed 
for land and other resources


JEWISH SUPERIORITY

The assertion that Israel is the only civilized Apollonian society, despite its 
acknowledged racialism and open discussion of ethnic deportations, reveals 
Slezkine’s belief in Jewish moral and intellectual superiority. Indeed, Slezkine 
regards both European individualism and the European nation-state as imitations of preexisting Jewish accomplishments: “Europeans imitated Jews not 
only in being modern [by becoming individualists interacting with strangers], 
but also in being ancient” [i.e., by developing ethnically based nation-states] (p. 
44). So we read condescending passages such as “among the most successful 
[of the European Mercurians] were Max Weber’s Protestants, who discovered a 
humorless, dignified way to be Jewish” (p. 41). This act of intellectual gymnastics 
depends on the following analogy: Jews act as an ethnically based tribe within 
societies, seeing non-Jews as strangers; Europeans establish tribal nation-states 
while behaving as individualists within their societies (seeing other Europeans 
as strangers). The sweeping conclusion: Jews are the progenitors therefore of 
both aspects of modernity: economic individualism and the ethnically based 
nation-state. The Holocaust then occurred because the European nation-state, 
although an imitation of Judaism, failed somehow to be sufficiently Jewish: 
“In the hands of heavily armed, thoroughly bureaucratized, and imperfectly 
Judaized Apollonians, Mercurian exclusivity and fastidiousness became 
relentlessly expansive. In the hands of messianically inclined Apollonians,

it turned lethal—especially to the Mercurians. The Holocaust had as much to 
do with tradition as it did with modernity” (p. 46). 
But it is a huge stretch to argue from an analogy—and a loose one at that—to 
actual imitation and influence. (And one just doesn’t know what to say about 
his claim that Europeans perpetrated the Holocaust because they had become 
imperfect Jews.) Slezkine fails to provide any evidence that there is anything 
but a hazy and forced logical connection between European individualism 
and the Jewish role as a Diaspora people living among strangers. The reality 
is that by becoming individualists, Western Europeans returned to distinctive 
roots buried in their primeval past,24 whereas Judaism, because of its deepseated tribalism, was widely regarded by Enlightenment intellectuals as an 
outmoded relic. Indeed, several Jewish commentators have noted that the postEnlightenment forms of Judaism have essentially been responses to the corrosive 
effects of European civilization, with its emphasis on individualism and ethnic 
assimilation, on Judaism as an ethnically based collectivist group—what early 
Zionist Arthur Ruppin described as “the destructive influence of European 
civilization” on Judaism because of its tendency to break down group barriers 
and lead eventually to assimilation and intermarriage Moreover, as Slezkine 
notes, Jews are not really individualists at all. Even in the modern world, the 
tribal approach of the Jews in economic enterprises employs ethnic kinship as 
a central component, whereas the individualistic approach of the Europeans 
sees this as illegitimate (p. 43). The bottom line is that it is ridiculous to claim 
that Jews are individualists because they treat outsiders as individuals while 
acknowledging that they retain a powerful ingroup consciousness and are 
masters of ethnic networking.

 It is no stretch at all, however, to show that Jews have achieved a preeminent 
position in Europe and America, and Slezkine provides us with statistics of Jewish 
domination only dimly hinted at in the following examples from Europe in the 
late nineteenth century to the rise of National Socialism. Austria: All but one bank 
in fin de siècle Vienna was administered by Jews, and Jews constituted 70% of the 
stock exchange council; Hungary: between 50 and 90 percent of all industry was 
controlled by Jewish banking families, and 71% of the most wealthy taxpayers 
were Jews; Germany: Jews were overrepresented among the economic elite by a 
factor of 33. Similar massive overrepresentation was also to be found in educational 
attainment and among professionals (e.g., Jews constituted 62% of the lawyers 
in Vienna in 1900, 25% in Prussia in 1925, 34% in Poland, and 51% in Hungary). 
Indeed, “the universities, ‘free’ professions, salons, coffeehouses, concert halls, 
and art galleries in Berlin, Vienna, and Budapest became so heavily Jewish that 
liberalism and Jewishness became almost indistinguishable” (p. 63).

Slezkine documents the well-known fact that, as Moritz Goldstein famously 
noted in 1912, “We Jews administer the spiritual possessions of Germany.” 
However, he regards Jewish cultural dominance, not only in Germany but 
throughout Eastern Europe and Austria, as completely benign: “The secular it turned lethal—especially to the Mercurians. The Holocaust had as much to 
do with tradition as it did with modernity” (p. 46). 

But it is a huge stretch to argue from an analogy—and a loose one at that—to 
actual imitation and influence. (And one just doesn’t know what to say about 
his claim that Europeans perpetrated the Holocaust because they had become 
imperfect Jews.) Slezkine fails to provide any evidence that there is anything

noted in 1912, “We Jews administer the spiritual possessions of Germany.” 
However, he regards Jewish cultural dominance, not only in Germany but 
throughout Eastern Europe and Austria, as completely benign: “The secular

Jewish elite under the banner of Marxism in the Soviet Union, his comments on 
psychoanalysis bear mentioning. Psychoanalysis “moved to the United States to 
reinforce democratic citizenship with a much-needed new prop…. In America, 
where nationwide tribal metaphors could not rely on theories of biological 
descent, Freudianism came in very handy indeed” by erecting the “Explicitly 
Therapeutic State” (pp. 79–80). The establishment of the Explicitly Therapeutic 
State was much aided by yet another Jewish intellectual movement, the 
Frankfurt School, which combined psychoanalysis and Marxism. The result was 
a culture of critique which fundamentally aimed not only at de-legitimizing 
the older American culture, but even attempted to alter or obliterate human 
nature itself: “The statistical connection between ‘the Jewish question’ and 
the hope for a new species of mankind seems fairly strong” (p. 90). 

And when people don’t cooperate in becoming a new species, there’s always 
murder. Slezkine describes Walter Benjamin, an icon of the Frankfurt School and 
darling of the current crop of postmodern intellectuals, “with glasses on his nose, 
autumn in his soul and vicarious murder in his heart” (p. 216), a comment that 
illustrates the fine line between murder and cultural criticism, especially when 
engaged in by ethnic outsiders. Indeed, on another occasion, Benjamin stated, 
“Hatred and [the] spirit of sacrifice…are nourished by the image of enslaved 
ancestors rather than that of liberated grandchildren.”29 Although Slezkine 
downplays this aspect of Jewish motivation, Jews’ lachrymose perceptions of 
their history—their images of enslaved ancestors—were potent motivators of 
the hatred unleashed by the upheavals of the twentieth century. 
Slezkine is entirely correct that Marxism, psychoanalysis, and the Frankfurt 
School were fundamentally Jewish intellectual movements. However, he fails 
to provide anything like a detailed account of how these ideologies served 
specifically Jewish interests, most generally in combating anti-Semitism and 
subverting ethnic identification among Europeans Indeed, a major premise 
of his treatment is that Jewish radicals were not Jews at all.


WERE JEWISH RADICALS JEWS?

Slezkine recounts the vast overrepresentation of Jews in the radical left in 
Europe and America. His attempts to explain this cover some familiar ground: 
Jewish intellectual opposition to the status quo resulting from their marginal 
social status (Thorsten Veblen); Jewish leftism as a secular, universalized form 
of traditional Jewish messianism and rationalism in which Jewish leftists are 
descendents of the Old Testament prophets calling for social justice (Lev 
Shternberg, dean of Soviet anthropologists); Jewish Communists as recreating traditional Jewish culture forms—especially scriptural interpretation and 
intense teacher-student relationships—in a Communist setting (historian Jaff 
Schatz). Slezkine’s own contribution is to argue that Jewish radicals were 
in revolt against their families, “rejecting the world of their fathers because 
it seemed to embody the connection between Judaism and antisocialism

(understood as commercialism, tribalism, and patriarchy)…the real reason 
for their common revulsion was the feeling that capitalism and Jewishness 
were one and the same thing” (pp. 96, 98). “Most Jewish rebels did not fight 
the state in order to become free Jews; they fought the state in order to become 
free of Jewishness—and thus Free” (p. 152).

This is a very useful theory, of course—useful because it denies that Jewish 
radicals were Jews at all, that in fact they were anti-Jews (if not anti-Semites—and 
there’s the rub). When Slezkine then goes on to recount the Jewish role as an 
elite in the most murderous regime in European history, we are led to believe 
that the only connection of those Jews with Jewishness is genealogical: Russian 
Jewish radicals, lovers of Pushkin and Tolstoy (as their counterparts in Poland, 
Hungary, and Germany loved Adam Mickiewicz, Sandór Petőfi, and Goethe), 
idealistically and selflessly set out to fashion a secular utopia of social justice 
by overcoming Apollonian backwardness even as they rejected their Jewish 
origins and all things Jewish. 

His evidence for this is rather thin, but even in the examples Slezkine uses 
to illustrate his point it is clear that these Jewish radicals hated everything 
about their national cultures except for one or two literary figures. The rest 
would have to go. As Exhibit A, Slezkine presents Georg Lukács, the son of a 
prominent Jewish capitalist, who describes his profound discontent with his 
father’s way of life. But Lukács also expresses his hatred for “the whole of official 
Hungary”—how he extended his unhappiness with his father to “cover the 
whole of Magyar life, Magyar history, and Magyar literature indiscriminately 
(save for Petőfi)” (p. 97). Ah, yes. Save for Petőfi. All else—the people and the 
culture—would have to go, by mass murder if necessary. (Lazar Kaganovich, 
the most prolific Jewish mass murderer of the Stalinist era, is pictured at 
the end of his life reading Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Turgenev [pp. 97–98].) But 
rather than see this as an aspect of traditional Jewish hatred for non-Jews and 
their culture, souped up and rationalized with a veneer of Marxism, Slezkine 
explains these radicals as enlightened Mercurians who wished to destroy the 
old culture except for a few classics of modern literature. We may give thanks 
to know that Shakespeare would have survived the revolution.

Another of Slezkine’s examples is Lev Kopelev, a Soviet writer who 
witnessed and rationalized the Ukrainian famine as “historical necessity” (p. 
230). Slezkine states categorically that Kopelev did not identify as a Jew, but 
his own material indicates the complexity of the matter. Kopelev identified 
himself on Soviet documents as “Jewish” but claimed that was only because 
he did not want to be seen as a “‘cowardly apostate,’ and—after World War 
II—because he did not want to renounce those who had been murdered for 
being Jewish” (p. 241). To the external world, Kopelev is a proud Jew, but to 
his close associates—in his “heart of hearts”— he is only a Communist and 
Soviet patriot. But of course many of his close associates were ethnic Jews, and 
he shed no tears for the Ukrainian and Russian peasants and nationalists who

were murdered in the name of international socialism even as he mourned 
the loss of Jews murdered because they were Jews. By World War II he had 
become a “leading ideologue of Russian patriotism” (p. 279), developing “an 
acute sense of hurt and injustice on behalf of Russia, Russian history, and the 
Russian word” (p. 280) as he attempted to rally the Russians to do battle with the 
Germans. Russian patriotism had suddenly become useful—much as, I would 
argue, harnessing the patriotism and high regard for military service among 
Americans has been useful for Jewish neoconservatives eager to rearrange the 
politics of the Middle East in the interests of Israel. Ideology is a wonderfully 
effective instrument in the service of self-deception (or deception). 

Probably more typical of the Jewish identity of the Bolsheviks is the account 
of Vitaly Rubin, a prominent philosopher and an ethnic Jew, who recounted 
his career at a top Moscow school in the 1930s where over half the students 
were Jewish:
Understandably, the Jewish question did not arise there. Not only did 
it not arise in the form of anti-Semitism, it did not arise at all. All the 
Jews knew themselves to be Jews but considered everything to do with 
Jewishness a thing of the past. I remember thinking of my father’s stories 
about his childhood, heder [Jewish elementary school], and traditional 
Jewish upbringing as something consigned to oblivion. None of that had 
anything to do with me. There was no active desire to renounce one’s 
Jewishness. The problem simply did not exist (pp. 253–254).
These Jews clearly have a Jewish identity but they have been removed from 
traditional Jewish religious cultural forms. In such a predominantly Jewish 
milieu, there was no need to renounce their Jewish identity and no need to 
push aggressively for Jewish interests because they had achieved elite status. And yet, just prior to World War II, as Russians started replacing Jews among 
the political elite and Nazism emerged as an officially anti-Jewish ideology, 
overt Jewish identity reemerged. Following World War II, Israel began exerting 
its gravitational pull on Jews, much to the chagrin of a suspicious Stalin. The 
visit of Golda Meir in 1948 and the outpouring of Jewish support for Zionism 
that it aroused was a watershed event for Soviet Jewry. Stalin reacted to it by 
initiating a campaign against public Jews and Yiddish culture.
It is interesting in this regard that the leading Soviet spokesmen on antiSemitism were both ethnic Jews with non-Jewish sounding names, Emilian 
Yaroslavsky (Gubelman) and Yuri Larin (Lurie). Both refer to Jews in the third 
person (p. 245), as if they themselves were not Jews. But when Larin tried to 
explain the embarrassing fact that Jews were “preeminent, overabundant, 
dominant, and so on” (p. 251) among the elite in the Soviet Union, he mentioned 
the “unusually strong sense of solidarity and a predisposition toward mutual 
help and support” (p. 252)—ethnic networking by any other name. 

Obviously, “mutual help and support” require that Jews recognize each 
other as Jews. Jewish identity may not have been much discussed, but it operated 
nonetheless, even if subconsciously, in the rarefied circles at the top of Soviet 
society. An example not presented by Slezkine is recounted in a report of 1950 to 
the central committee on Jewish activities at an aircraft production facility:
In a number of extremely important departments of the Central AeroHydrodynamic Institute there are workers due to be substituted for 
political reasons. They gather around themselves people of the same 
nationality, impose the habit of praising one another (while making 
others erroneously believe that they are indispensable), and force their 
protégés through to high posts
Indeed, there is no other way to explain the extraordinary percentages of 
Jews throughout elite institutions, which became apparent when the purges 
began in the late 1940s (see below). High IQ and achievement motivation 
can only go so far, and cannot explain why, for example, in the late 1940s 
Jews made up 80% of the Soviet Academy of Science Institute of Literature 
(Pushkin House) (p. 302), 42% of the directors of Moscow theaters, over half of 
Soviet circus directors (p. 301), or eight of the top ten directors of the Bolshoi 
Theater In the case of Pushkin House, the opponents of the dominant clique 
stated that it had been forged “by long-lasting relationships of families and 
friends, mutual protection, homogeneous (Jewish) national composition, and 
anti-patriotic (anti-Russian) tendencies.”33
The reality is that Jewish identity always becomes more salient when 
Jews feel threatened or feel that their interests as Jews are at stake, but Jewish 
identity becomes submerged when Jewish interests coincide with other interests 
and identities (This is a human universal and presumably accounts for the 
fact that the American Founding Fathers felt no need to carefully define the 
cultural and ethnic parameters of their creation; they assumed the racial and 
cultural homogeneity of the Republic35 and perceived no threat to its control 
by themselves and their descendants.) The relative submergence of Jewish 
identity within the Jewish milieu in elite circles of the Soviet Union during the 
1920s and 1930s is a poor indicator of whether or not these people identified 
as Jews or would do so when in later years Jewish and Soviet identities began 
to diverge, when National Socialism reemphasized Jewish identity, or when 
Israel emerged as a beacon for Jewish identity and loyalty. A similar stance 
may be observed among present-day Jewish neoconservatives, who argue that 
the United States has a deep interest in democratizing the Middle East. The 
confluence of their interests as Jews in promoting the policies of the Israeli right 
wing and their construction of American interests allows them to submerge 
or even deny the relevance of their Jewish identity while posing as American 
patriots But if Israeli and American policy began to diverge significantly, 
Jewish interests would almost certainly control their attitudes and behavior. 
Indeed, since neoconservative Zionism of the Likud Party variety is well known 
for promoting a confrontation between the U.S. and the entire Muslim world, 
their policy recommendations best fit a pattern of loyalty to their ethnic group, 
not to America

In a previous work I advanced several reasons for supposing that Jews 
continued to identify as Jews in the USSR, none of which is challenged by 
Slezkine’s treatment: (1) Persons were classified as Jews depending on their 
ethnic background, at least partly because of residual anti-Jewish attitudes; 
this would tend to impose a Jewish identity on these individuals and make it 
difficult to assume an exclusive identity as a member of a larger, more inclusive 
political group. (2) Many Jewish Bolsheviks, such as those in Evsektsiya (the 
Jewish section of the Communist Party) and the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, 
aggressively sought to establish a secular Jewish subculture; these phenomena 
are virtually ignored by Slezkine. (3) Very few Jews on the left envisioned a 
postrevolutionary society without a continuation of Judaism as a group; indeed, 
the predominant ideology among Jewish leftists was that postrevolutionary 
society would end anti-Semitism because it would end class conflict and the 
peculiar Jewish occupational profile. (4) The behavior of American Communists 
shows that Jewish identity and the primacy of Jewish interests over Communist 
interests were commonplace among individuals who were ethnically Jewish 
Communists. (5) The existence of Jewish crypsis in other times and places was 
combined with the possibility that self-deception, identificatory flexibility, and 
identificatory ambivalence are important components of Judaism as a group 
evolutionary strategy

And in the end, despite the rationalizations of many Soviet Jews and 
Slezkine on Jewish identity, it was blood that mattered. By the time of World 
War II, most Jews 
knew that they were, in some sense, Jews. They may never have been to 
a synagogue, seen a menorah, heard Yiddish or Hebrew, tasted gefilte 
fish or indeed met their grandparents. But they knew they were Jews 
in the Soviet sense, which was also—in essence—the Nazi sense. They 
were Jews by blood (p. 286). 
They reemerged as Jews to fight the Nazis and to solicit the support of 
American Jews to pressure their government to enter the war and provide 
aid to the Soviet Union. Jewish spokesmen visited New York proclaiming that 
“the Jewish people—‘ethnic’ or religious, Communist, Zionist, or traditionalist—were one family” (p. 290). 

Moreover, Slezkine leaves out an enormous amount of evidence that conflicts 
with his Jewish radicalism-as-patricide thesis, evidence indicating that in general 
Jewish radicals did identify as Jews and acted to promote specific Jewish interests. 
Certainly Jewish radicals often rejected their fathers’ religion and their way of 
life, but all the evidence points to their identifying in different ways as Jews, 
not losing their Jewish identity to become de-ethnicized moral crusaders against 
capitalism. Slezkine uses Franz Boas to illustrate his patricide theory, because 
Boas was a radical Jew who recognized “the shackles of tradition” (p. 98). But 
he fails to note that Boas was hardly in rebellion against his own family. Boas 
was reared in a “Jewish-liberal” family in which the revolutionary ideals of 1848 remained influential,39 and there is ample evidence of his strong Jewish 
identification and concern with anti-Semitism

Besides a few individual cases like Lukács and Boas, the only general 
evidence that Slezkine provides for the patricide thesis comes from Jaff 
Schatz’s study of the generation of Jewish Communists who dominated the 
Communist movement in Poland beginning in the 1930s. But he provides a 
mangled account of Schatz’s work These Jews did indeed reject their parents’ 
religion, but the result of their Yiddish upbringing was “a deep core of their 
identity, values, norms, and attitudes with which they entered the rebellious 
period of their youth and adulthood. This core was to be transformed in the 
processes of acculturation, secularization, and radicalization sometimes even 
to the point of explicit denial. However, it was through this deep layer that 
all later perceptions were filtered.”42 Most of these individuals spoke Yiddish 
in their daily lives and had only a poor command of Polish even after joining the 
party. They socialized entirely with other Jews whom they met in the Jewish 
world of work, neighborhood, and Jewish social and political organizations. 
After they became Communists, they dated and married among themselves, 
and their social gatherings were conducted in Yiddish. Their mentors and 
principal influences were other ethnic Jews, including especially Luxemburg 
and Trotsky, and when they recalled personal heroes, they were mostly 
Jews whose exploits achieved semimythical proportions.

In general, Jews who joined the Communist movement did not first reject 
their ethnic identity, and there were many who “cherished Jewish culture…[and] 
dreamed of a society in which Jews would be equal as Jews.”43 It was common 
for individuals to combine a strong Jewish identity with Marxism as well 
as various combinations of Zionism and Bundism (a movement of Jewish 
socialists). Moreover, the attraction of Polish Jews to Communism was greatly 
facilitated by their knowledge that Jews had attained high-level positions of 
power and influence in the Soviet Union and that the Soviet government had 
established a system of Jewish education and culture. In both the Soviet Union 
and Poland, Communism was seen as opposing anti-Semitism. In marked 
contrast, during the 1930s the Polish government enacted policies which 
excluded Jews from public-sector employment, established quotas on Jewish 
representation in universities and the professions, and organized boycotts of 
Jewish businesses and artisans Clearly, Jews perceived Communism as good 
for Jews, and indeed a major contribution of Slezkine’s book is to document 
that Communism was good for Jews: It was a movement that never threatened 
Jewish group continuity, and it held the promise of Jewish power and influence 
and the end of state-sponsored anti-Semitism. And when this group achieved 
power in Poland after World War II, they liquidated the Polish nationalist 
movement, outlawed anti-Semitism, and established Jewish cultural and 
economic institutions.

Slezkine also fails to note that in the United States a strong Jewish identification 
was typical of Jewish radicals and that Jewish support for the left typically waxed 
and waned depending on specifically Jewish issues, particularly those related to 
anti-Semitism and support for Israel The Jewish Old Left was a recognized 
part of the Jewish community, and American Jewish leftists during the 1960s 
were the only leftists who didn’t reject their parents—they really were “red 
diaper babies.” 

It is also remarkable that the revolutionary movement in tsarist Russia 
ceased being anti-Jewish when Jews attained highly visible and prominent 
positions in the movement, even though workers and peasants participated 
in anti-Jewish pogroms from 1880 to 1905 and continued to harbor anti-Jewish 
attitudes. As Slezkine himself notes, Jews were the only group that was not 
criticized by the revolutionary movement (p. 157), even though most Russians, 
and especially the lower classes whose cause they were supposedly championing, had very negative attitudes toward Jews When, in 1915, Maxim Gorky, 
a strong philosemite, published a survey of Russian attitudes toward Jews, 
the most common response was typified by the comment that “the congenital, 
cruel, and consistent egoism of the Jews is everywhere victorious over the 
good-natured, uncultured, trusting Russian peasant or merchant” (p. 159). 

There were concerns that all of Russia would pass into Jewish hands and that 
Russians would become slaves of the Jews. In the end, as Slezkine shows, as 
a result of the Revolution this prediction was not far off the mark. But in any 
case, one would think that if radical Jews had ceased being Jews, they would 
have been severely critical of the Jewish role in the pre-Soviet economy.
The other huge lacuna in Slezkine’s presentation is that he portrays Jewish 
radicals as typically the offspring of successful Jewish capitalists—like Georg 
Lukács—who scorn their fathers and wish for nothing more than to destroy 
Judaism in order to achieve personal freedom and make the world safe for 
humanity: “Marxism attributed [Jewish patricide] to the proletariat and 
urged the killing (more or less metaphorical) of the bad fathers, so as to 
emancipate the world from Judaism and make sure that no sons would 
have to kill their fathers ever again” (p. 100). Because he wishes to portray 
Jews as quintessentially modern Mercurians, Slezkine repeatedly shows 
how Jews dominated the economy, the universities, and the culture of 
Eastern Europe—indeed, his book is probably the best, most up-to-date 
account of Jewish economic and cultural preeminence in Europe (and 
America) that we have. But that is far from the whole story. A prime force 
resulting in Jewish radicalism was the grinding poverty of most Jews in Eastern 
Europe. Jews had overshot their economic niche: The economy was unable to 
support the burgeoning Jewish population in the sorts of positions that Jews 
had traditionally filled, with the result that a large percentage of the Jewish 
population became mired in poverty (along with much higher percentages of 
the non-Jewish population). The result was a cauldron of ethnic hostility, with
governmental restrictions on Jewish economic activity and representation in 
educational institutions, rampant anti-Jewish attitudes, and increasing Jewish 
desperation

The main Jewish response to this situation was an upsurge of fundamentalist 
extremism that coalesced in the Hasidic movement and, later in the nineteenth 
century, in political radicalism and Zionism as solutions to Jewish problems. 
Slezkine devotes one line to the fact that Jewish populations in Eastern Europe had 
the highest rate of natural increase of any European population in the nineteenth 
century (p. 115), but this was an extremely important part of Eastern Europe’s 
“Jewish problem.” Anti-Semitism and the exploding Jewish population, combined 
with economic adversity, were of critical importance for producing the great 
numbers of disaffected Jews who dreamed of deliverance in various messianic 
movements—the ethnocentric mysticism of the Kabbala and Hasidism, Zionism, 
or the dream of a Marxist political revolution. Jews emigrated in droves from 
Eastern Europe but the problems remained. And in the case of the Marxists, the 
main deliverance was to be achieved not by killing Judaism, as Slezkine suggests, 
but by the destruction of the traditional societies of Eastern Europe as a panacea 
for Jewish poverty and for anti-Semitism.

In fact, the vast majority of Jews in Eastern Europe in the late nineteenth 
and early twentieth centuries were hardly the modern Mercurians that Slezkine 
portrays them as being. Slezkine does note that well into the twentieth century 
the vast majority of Eastern European Jews could not speak the languages of the 
non-Jews living around them, and he does a good job of showing their intense 
ingroup feeling and their attitudes that non-Jews were less than human But 
he ignores their medieval outlook on life, their obsession with the Kabbala (the 
writings of Jewish mystics), their superstition and anti-rationalism, and their 
belief in “magical remedies, amulets, exorcisms, demonic possession (dybbuks), 
ghosts, devils, and teasing, mischievous genies.”49 These supposedly modern 
Mercurians had an attitude of absolute faith in the person of the tsadik, their rebbe, 
who was a charismatic figure seen by his followers literally as the personification 
of God in the world. (Attraction to charismatic leaders is a fundamental feature of 
Jewish social organization—apparent as much among religious fundamentalists 
as among Jewish political radicals or elite Jewish intellectuals.)50


BOLSHEVISM AS A JEWISH REVOLUTION

Slezkine’s main contribution is to summarize previously available data 
and to extend our understanding of Jewish dominance of the revolutionary 
movements before 1917, and of Soviet society thereafter. (Oddly, he makes 
only a passing reference to Albert Lindemann’s important Esau’s Tears, which 
makes many of the same points.) Not only were Jews vastly overrepresented 
among revolutionaries, they “were particularly well represented at the top, 
among theoreticians, journalists, and leaders” (p. 155). Radical Jews, like other 
Jews, were very talented, highly intelligent, hardworking, and in addition 
dedicated to creating effective ethnic networks These traits propelled them 
to the top of radical organizations and made the organizations themselves 
more effective. 

But if Jews dominated radical and revolutionary organizations, they were 
immeasurably aided by philosemites like Gorky who, in Albert Lindemann’s 
term, were “jewified non-Jews”—“a term, freed of its ugly connotations, 
[that] might be used to underline an often overlooked point: Even in Russia 
there were some non-Jews, whether Bolsheviks or not, who respected Jews, 
praised them abundantly, imitated them, cared about their welfare, and 
established intimate friendships or romantic liaisons with them.”52 (As noted 
above, many of the non-Jewish elite in the USSR had Jewish wives.) What 
united the Jews and philosemites was their hatred for what Lenin (who had 
a Jewish grandfather) called “the thick-skulled, boorish, inert, and bearishly 
savage Russian or Ukrainian peasant”—the same peasant Gorky described as 
“savage, somnolent, and glued to his pile of manure” (p. 163). It was attitudes 
like these that created the climate that justified the slaughter of many millions 
of peasants under the new regime. Philosemites continued to be common 
among the non-Jewish elite in the USSR, even in the 1950s, when Jews began 
to be targeted as Jews. One such philosemite was Pavel Sudoplatov, a Slav 
married to a Jew and with many Jewish friends, who was a high-ranking 
secret police official with a great deal of blood on his hands. The only murder 
he unequivocally condemned in his memoirs was that of Paul Mikhoels, a 
Jewish ethnic activist associated with the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee. 
Figures like Gorky and Sudoplatov were critical to the success of Jews 
in the Soviet Union. This is a general principle of Jewish political activity in 
a Diaspora situation: Because Jews tend to constitute a tiny percentage of a 
society, they need to make alliances with non-Jews whose perceived interests 
dovetail with theirs. Non-Jews have a variety of reasons for being associated 
with Jewish interests, including career advancement, close personal relationships 
or admiration for individual Jews, and deeply held personal convictions
Gorky’s love for the Jews—what Slezkine terms “the bitter, ardent, and 
hopeless love of self-described Apollonians for beautiful Mercurians” (p. 
165)—was boundless. Gorky saw Jews as possessors of “heroic” idealism, 
“all-probing, all-scrutinizing”; “this idealism, which expresses itself in their 
tireless striving to remake the world according to new principles of equality 
and justice, is the main, and possibly the only, reason for the hostility toward 
Jews” (quoted on p. 164). 

Despite the important role of Jews among the Bolsheviks, most Jews were 
not Bolsheviks before the revolution. However, Jews were prominent among the 
Bolsheviks, and once the revolution was under way, the vast majority of Russian 
Jews became sympathizers and active participants. Jews were particularly 
visible in the cities and as leaders in the army and in the revolutionary councils 
and committees. For example, there were 23 Jews among the 62 Bolsheviks in 
the All-Russian Central Executive Committee elected at the Second Congress 
of Soviets in October, 1917. Jews were the leaders of the movement, and to a 
great extent they were its public face. Slezkine quotes historian Mikhail Beizer 
who notes, commenting on the situation in Leningrad, that “Jewish names 
were constantly popping up in newspapers. Jews spoke relatively more often 
than others at rallies, conferences, and meetings of all kinds.”54 In general, Jews 
were deployed in supervisory positions rather than positions that placed them 
in physical danger. In a Politburo meeting of April 18, 1919, Trotsky urged 
that Jews be redeployed because there were relatively few Jews in frontline 
combat units, while Jews constituted a “vast percentage” of the Cheka at the 
front and in the Executive Committees at the front and at the rear. This pattern 
had caused “chauvinist agitation” in the Red Army (p. 187).

Jewish representation at the top levels of the Cheka and OGPU (the acronyms 
by which the secret police was known in different periods) has often been the 
focus of those stressing Jewish involvement in the revolution and its aftermath. 
Slezkine provides statistics on Jewish overrepresentation in these organizations, 
especially in supervisory roles, and agrees with Leonard Schapiro’s comment 
that “anyone who had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Cheka stood 
a very good chance of finding himself confronted with and possibly shot by a 
Jewish investigator” (p. 177). During the 1930s the secret police, then known 
as the NKVD, “was one of the most Jewish of all Soviet institutions” (p. 254), 
with 42 of its 111 top officials being Jewish. At this time 12 of the 20 NKVD 
directorates were headed by ethnic Jews, including those in charge of state 
security, police, labor camps, and resettlement (i.e., deportation). The Gulag 
was headed by ethnic Jews from its beginning in 1930 until the end of 1938, a 
period that encompasses the worst excesses of the Great Terror. They were, 
in Slezkine’s words, “Stalin’s willing executioners” (p. 103).
The Bolsheviks continued to apologize for Jewish overrepresentation 
until the topic became taboo in the 1930s. And it was not until the late 1930s 
that there was a rise in visibility and assertiveness of “anti-Semites, ethnic 
nationalists, and advocates of proportional representation” (p. 188). By this 
time the worst of the slaughters in the Gulag, the purges, and the contrived 
famines had been completed. 

The prominence of Jews in the Revolution and its aftermath was not lost 
on participants on both sides, including influential figures such as Winston 
Churchill, who wrote that the role of Jews in the revolution “is certainly a 
very great one; it probably outweighs all others.”55 Slezkine highlights similar 
comments in a book published in 1927 by V. V. Shulgin, a Russian nationalist, 
who experienced firsthand the murderous acts of the Bolsheviks in his native 
Kiev in 1919: “We do not like the fact that this whole terrible thing was done 
on the Russian back and that it has cost us unutterable losses. We do not like the 
fact that you, Jews, a relatively small group within the Russian population,

participated in this vile deed out of all proportion to your numbers” (p. 181; italics in 
original). Slezkine does not disagree with this assessment, but argues that Jews 
were hardly the only revolutionaries (p. 180). This is certainly true, but does 
not affect my argument that Jewish involvement was a necessary condition, not 
merely a sufficient condition, for the success of the Bolshevik Revolution and its 
aftermath Slezkine’s argument clearly supports the Jews-as-necessary-condition 
claim, especially because of his emphasis on the leadership role of Jews. 
However, the claim that Jewish involvement was a necessary condition 
is itself an understatement because, as Shulgin noted, the effectiveness of 
Jewish revolutionaries was far out of proportion to the number of Jews. A 
claim that a group constituting a large proportion of the population was 
necessary to the success of a movement would be unexceptional. But the 
critical importance of Jews occurred even though Jews constituted less 
than 5% of the Russian population around the time of the Revolution, and 
they were much less represented in the major urban areas of Moscow and 
Leningrad prior to the Revolution because they were prevented from living 
there by the Pale of Settlement laws Slezkine is correct that Jews were not 
the only revolutionaries, but his point only underscores the importance of 
philosemitism and other alliances Jews typically must make in Diaspora 
situations in order to advance their perceived interests. 

In 1923, several Jewish intellectuals published a collection of essays admitting 
the “bitter sin” of Jewish complicity in the crimes of the Revolution. In the words 
of a contributor, I. L. Bikerman, “it goes without saying that not all Jews are 
Bolsheviks and not all Bolsheviks are Jews, but what is equally obvious is that 
disproportionate and immeasurably fervent Jewish participation in the torment 
of half-dead Russia by the Bolsheviks” (p. 183). Many of the commentators on 
Jewish Bolsheviks noted the “transformation” of Jews: In the words of another 
Jewish commentator, G. A. Landau, “cruelty, sadism, and violence had seemed 
alien to a nation so far removed from physical activity.” And another Jewish 
commentator, Ia. A Bromberg, noted that:
the formerly oppressed lover of liberty had turned into a tyrant of 
“unheard-of-despotic arbitrariness”…. The convinced and unconditional 
opponent of the death penalty not just for political crimes but for the 
most heinous offenses, who could not, as it were, watch a chicken being 
killed, has been transformed outwardly into a leather-clad person with 
a revolver and, in fact, lost all human likeness (pp. 183–184). 
This psychological “transformation” of Russian Jews was probably not 
all that surprising to the Russians themselves, given Gorky’s finding that 
Russians prior to the Revolution saw Jews as possessed of “cruel egoism” 
and that they were concerned about becoming slaves of the Jews. Gorky 
himself remained a philosemite to the end, despite the prominent Jewish role 
in the murder of approximately twenty million of his ethnic kin, 58 but after 
the Revolution he commented that “the reason for the current anti-Semitism

in Russia is the tactlessness of the Jewish Bolsheviks. The Jewish Bolsheviks, not 
all of them but some irresponsible boys, are taking part in the defiling of 
the holy sites of the Russian people. They have turned churches into movie 
theaters and reading rooms without considering the feelings of the Russian 
people.” However, Gorky did not blame the Jews for this: “The fact that the 
Bolsheviks sent the Jews, the helpless and irresponsible Jewish youths, to do 
these things, does smack of provocation, of course. But the Jews should have 
refrained” (p. 186). 

Those who carried out the mass murder and dispossession of the Russian 
peasants saw themselves, at least in their public pronouncements, as doing 
what was necessary in pursuit of the greater good. This was the official view 
not only of the Soviet Union, where Jews formed a dominant elite, but also was 
the “more or less official view” among Jewish intellectuals in the United States 
(p. 215) and elsewhere. (It is still far more common for leftist intellectuals to 
bemoan McCarthyism than the horrors of the USSR) 

It is for the sake of creating a perfect human being—Apollonian in body 
and Mercurian in mind—that Levinson steels himself for doing what is 
“necessary,” including the requisitioning of a weeping farmer’s last pig 
and the killing of a wounded comrade too weak to be evacuated…. [T]he 
greater the personal responsibility for acts ordinarily considered evil, the 
more visible the signs of election and the inner strength they bespoke. 
Demonic as well as Promethean, Bolshevik commissars ‘carried within 
them’ the pain of historical necessity” (p. 194).

 Levinson, a character in A. Fedeev’s The Rout (1926), a prominent example of 
socialist realism in the early Soviet period, is not ideologically Jewish, “but there 
is little doubt that for reasons of both aesthetic and sociological verisimilitude, 
canonical Jewishness seemed an appropriate expression of the Bolshevik vision 
of disembodied consciousness triumphing over [peasant] inertia” (p. 193). So it 
is not surprising that Gorky’s mild rebuke of Jewish anti-Christian zealotry was 
too much for Esther Frumkina, a leader of the Party’s Jewish section. Frumkina 
accused Gorky of attacking “Jewish Communists for their selfless struggle against 
darkness and fanaticism” (p. 187). In their self-perceptions, Jews are selflessly 
altruistic even when acting out ancient hatreds. 


THE THREE GREAT JEWISH MIGRATIONS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY

Slezkine’s last and longest chapter describes the three great Jewish 
migrations of the twentieth century—to Israel, to America, and to the urban 
centers of the Soviet Union. Slezkine perceives all three through the lens of 
heroic Jewish self-perception. He sees the United States as a Jewish utopia 
precisely because it had only a “vestigial establishment tribalism” (p. 209) 
that could not long inhibit Jewish ascendancy: “The United States stood for 
unabashed Mercurianism, nontribal statehood, and the supreme sovereignty 
of capitalism and professionalism. It was—rhetorically—a collection if homines 
rationalistici artificiales, a nation of strangers held together by a common celebration of separateness (individualism) and rootlessness (immigration)” (p. 207). It 
was the only modern state…in which a Jew could be an equal citizen and a 
Jew at the same time. ‘America’ offered full membership without complete 
assimilation. Indeed, it seemed to require an affiliation with a subnational 
community as a condition of full membership in the political nation” (p. 
207). 

Slezkine sees post-World War II America as a Jewish utopia but seems 
only dimly aware that Jews to a great extent created their own utopia in the 
U.S. by undermining nativist sentiments that were common at least until after 
World War II. Slezkine emphasizes the Jewish role in institutionalizing the 
therapeutic state, but sees it as completely benign, rather than an aspect of the 
“culture of critique” that undermined the ethnic identities of white Americans: 
“By bringing Freudianism to America and by adopting it, briefly, as a salvation 
religion, [Jews] made themselves more American while making America more 
therapeutic” (p. 319). There is little discussion of the main anti-nativist intellectual movements, all of which were dominated by ethnically conscious Jews: 
Boasian anthropology, Horace Kallen and the development of the theory of 
America as a “proposition nation,” and the Frankfurt School which combined 
psychoanalysis and Marxism into a devastating weapon against the ethnic 
consciousness of white Americans. Nor does he discuss the role of Jewish 
activist organizations in altering the ethnic balance of the United States by 
promoting large-scale immigration from around the world. 

Slezkine also views the Jewish migration to Israel as heroic: “In both 
Jewish Palestine (the Yishuv) and Soviet Russia, brotherhood stood for the 
full identity of all true believers (always the few against the many) and their 
complete identification with the cause (ardently desired and genuinely felt 
by most young Jews in both places). Eventually, both revolutions evolved 
in the direction of greater hierarchy, institutionalized militarism, intense 
anxiety about aliens, and the cult of generals, boy soldiers, and elite forces, 
but between 1917 and the mid-1930s they were overflowing with youthful 
energy and the spirit of fraternal effort, and self-sacrifice” (p. 212). 
The passage is remarkable both for its pinpointing the ingroup/outgroup 
nature of the psychology of traditional Jewish groups, freed now of the Torah 
and the synagogue, and for its description of the ingroup psychology of mass 
murder (in the USSR) and ethnic cleansing (in the Middle East) as involving 
valiant self-sacrifice and pride in accomplishment. 

But Slezkine spends most of his energy by far in providing a fascinating 
chronicle of the Jewish rise to elite status in all areas of Soviet society—culture, 
the universities, professional occupations, the media, and government. In all 
cases, Jewish overrepresentation was most apparent at the pinnacles of success 
and influence. To take just the area of culture, Jews were highly visible as 
avant-garde artists, formalist theorists, polemicists, moviemakers, and poets. 

They were “among the most exuberant crusaders against ‘bourgeois’ habits 
during the Great Transformation; the most disciplined advocates of socialist 
realism during the ‘Great Retreat’ (from revolutionary internationalism); and 
the most passionate prophets of faith, hope, and combat during the Great 
Patriotic War against the Nazis” (p. 225). And, as their critics noticed, Jews were 
involved in anti-Christian propaganda. Mikhail Bulgakov, a Russian writer, 
noticed that the publishers of Godless magazine were Jews; he was “stunned” 
to find that Christ was portrayed as “a scoundrel and a cheat. It is not hard to 
see whose work it is. This crime is immeasurable” (p. 244).

Some of the juxtapositions are striking and seemingly intentional. On p. 230, 
Lev Kopelev is quoted on the need for firmness in confiscating the property of 
the Ukrainian peasants. Kopelev, who witnessed the famine that killed seven 
to ten million peasants, stated, “You mustn’t give in to debilitating pity. We are 
the agents of historical necessity. We are fulfilling our revolutionary duty. We 
are procuring grain for our socialist Fatherland. For the Five-Year Plan.” On 
the next page, Slezkine describes the life of the largely Jewish elite in Moscow 
and Leningrad, where they attended the theater, sent their children to the best 
schools, had peasant women for nannies, spent weekends at pleasant dachas, 
and vacationed at the Black Sea. 

Slezkine describes the NKVD as “one of the most Jewish of all Soviet 
institutions” and recounts the Jewish leadership of the Great Terror of the 
1930s (pp. 254 and 255). On p. 256, he writes that in 1937 the prototypical Jew 
who moved from the Pale of Settlement to Moscow to man elite positions 
in the Soviet state “probably would have been living in elite housing in 
downtown Moscow…with access to special stores, a house in the country 
(dacha), and a live-in peasant nanny or maid.…At least once a year, she would 
have traveled to a Black Sea sanatorium or a mineral spa in the Caucasus” 
(p. 256). Slezkine writes long and lovingly detailed sketches of life at the 
dachas of the elite—the “open verandas overlooking small gardens enclosed 
by picket fences or wildly overgrown yards” (p. 256), but the reader is left 
to his own imagination to visualize the horrors of the Ukrainian famine and 
the liquidation of the Kulaks. 

As Slezkine notes, most of the Soviet elite were not Jews, but Jews were 
far overrepresented among the elite (and Russians far underrepresented as a 
percentage of the population). Moreover, the Jews formed a far more cohesive 
core than the rest of the elite because of their common social and cultural 
background (p. 236). The common understanding that the new elite had a very 
large Jewish representation resulted in pervasive anti-Jewish attitudes. In 1926, 
an Agitprop report noted “The sense that the Soviet regime patronizes the Jews, 
that it is ‘the Jewish government,’ that the Jews cause unemployment, housing 
shortages, college admissions problems, price rises, and commercial speculation—this sense is instilled in the workers by all the hostile elements.… If it does 
not encounter resistance, the wave of anti-Semitism threatens to become, in the
very near future, a serious political question” (p. 244). Such widespread public 
perceptions about the role of Jews in the new government led to aggressive 
surveillance and repression of anti-Jewish attitudes and behavior, including 
the execution of Russian nationalists who expressed anti-Jewish attitudes. 
These public perceptions also motivated Jews to adopt a lower profile in the 
regime, as with Trotsky, who refused the post of commissar of internal affairs 
because it might lend further ammunition to the anti-Jewish arguments. From 
1927 to 1932 Stalin established an ambitious public campaign to combat antiSemitism that included fifty-six books published by the government and an 
onslaught of speeches, mass rallies, newspaper articles, and show trials “aimed 
at eradicating the evil” (p. 249).


THE DECLINE OF THE JEWS IN THE SOVIET UNION

Jews were able to maintain themselves as an elite until the end of the 
Soviet regime in 1991—this despite an official push for affirmative action–style 
programs to open up opportunities for the children of peasants and workers 
in the 1930s and to blunt the anti-Jewish feelings simmering at the lower levels 
of Soviet society. Jewish elite status persisted despite the Great Terror of the 
late 1930s, which disproportionately affected the political elite. On the whole, 
Jews were underrepresented as victims of the Great Terror. And although the 
Jewish percentage of the political elite did decline after the purges of the late 
1930s and the promotion of former peasants and working class Russians, this 
did not affect Jewish predominance as a professional, cultural, and managerial 
elite. Jews also retained their elite status despite Stalin’s campaign in the late 
1940s against Jewish ethnic and cultural institutions and their spokesmen. 
Jewish elite status remained even after the purge was expanded to all 
sectors of the Soviet elite, due at least partly to “the widespread sense [among 
Russians] that the great victory [in World War II] entitled them to a greater 
role in decision making” (p. 306). Slezkine shows the very high percentages 
of Jews in various institutions in the late 1940s, including the universities, the 
media, the foreign service, and the secret police. For example, the deans of 
philosophers, historians, and legal scholars were ethnic Jews, and, as already 
noted, Jews constituted 80% of the Soviet Academy of Science Institute of 
Literature. As for the Jewish role as “vanguard of the working class,” Jews 
still made up 23% of the staff at the Trade Union Council’s publication Trud
even after a purge that cut their numbers in half. 

The campaign against the Jews began only after the apogee of mass murder 
and deportations in the USSR, and was much less lethal than those mounted 
against a long list of other ethnic groups, whose typical fate was deportation 
under the most brutal of circumstances (Cossacks, Chechens, Crimean Tatars, 
Volga Germans, Moldavians, Kalmyks, Karachai, Balkars, Ingush, Greeks, 
Bulgars, Crimean Armenians, Meskhetian Turks, Kurds, and Khemshins). 
The campaign against the Jews was also much less consistent and effective
than the Soviet campaigns against the children of the former elite—the factory 
owners, the Cossack officers, and the middle classes and intelligentsia—had 
been (p. 308). 

Unlike the purges of the 1930s that sometimes targeted Jews as member 
of the elite (albeit at far less than their percentage of the elite), the anti-Jewish 
actions of the late 1940s and early 1950s were targeted at Jews because of 
their ethnicity. Similar purges were performed throughout Soviet-controlled 
Eastern Europe (pp. 313–314). “All three regimes [Poland, Romania, Hungary] 
resembled the Soviet Union of the 1920s insofar as they combined the ruling 
core of the old Communist underground, which was heavily Jewish, with a 
large pool of upwardly mobile Jewish professionals, who were, on average, 
the most trustworthy among the educated and the most educated among 
the trustworthy” (p. 314). Speaking of the situation in Poland, Khrushchev 
supported the anti-Jewish purge with his remark that “you have already too 
many Abramoviches.”60

Whereas in the 1920s and 1930s children of the pillars of the old order 
were discriminated against, now Jews were not only being purged because of 
their vast overrepresentation among the elite, but were being discriminated 
against in university admissions. Jews, the formerly loyal members of the elite 
and willing executioners of the bloodiest regime in history, now “found themselves among the aliens” (p. 310). Rather than rationalize their persecution as 
resulting from the iron laws of history, some Jews began to feel guilt for their 
former role. A Jewish woman writes that after her husband was arrested, her 
maid told her, “You are crying now, but you did not mind when my father 
was being dekulakized, martyred for no reason at all, and my whole family 
thrown out in the street” (p. 311). 

And so began the exodus of Jews. Stalin died and the anti-Jewish campaign 
fizzled, but the Jewish trajectory was definitely downhill. Jews retained their elite 
status and occupational profile until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, 
but “the special relationship between the Jews and the Soviet state had come 
to an end—or rather, the unique symbiosis in pursuit of world revolution had 
given way to a unique antagonism over two competing and incommensurate 
nationalisms” (p. 330). A response of the Russians was “massive affirmative 
action” (p. 333) aimed at giving greater representation to underrepresented 
ethnic groups. Jews were targets of suspicion because of their ethnic status, 
barred from some elite institutions, and limited in their opportunities for 
advancement. 

The Russians were taking back their country, and it wasn’t long before 
Jews became leaders of the dissident movement and began to seek to emigrate 
in droves to the United States, Western Europe, and Israel. Despite still 
possessing elite social status and far fewer disabilities than many groups 
(e.g., the overwhelming majority of the Soviet population was not allowed 
to live in cities and some Christian sects were banned), Jews perceived their 
situation as “unrelieved humiliation” (p. 339). Overt anti-Semitism was 
encouraged by the more covert official variety apparent in the limits on 
Jewish advancement. Under these circumstances, Jews became “in many 
ways, the core of the antiregime intelligentsia” (p. 340). Jewish dissidents 
whose parents had run the Gulags, the deportations, and the state-sponsored 
famines, now led the “urgent call for social justice” (p. 342). Jewish academics 
with “cult followings” (p. 342)—a familiar Jewish pattern61—and close 
ties to Western Jewish intellectuals became the intellectual vanguard and 
iconoclasts of the new culture of critique in the Soviet Union.

Applications to leave the USSR increased dramatically after Israel’s Six-Day 
War of 1967, which, as in the United States and Eastern Europe, resulted in an 
upsurge of Jewish identification and ethnic pride. The floodgates were eventually 
opened by Gorbachev in the late 1980s, and by 1994, 1 million Soviet Jews had 
emigrated—43% of the total. By 2002, there were only 230,000 Jews left in the 
Russian Federation, 0% of the population. These remaining Jews nevertheless 
exhibit the typical Ashkenazi pattern of high achievement and overrepresentation 
among the elite, including six of the seven oligarchs who emerged in control of 
the Soviet economy and media in the period of de-nationalization (p. 362). 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, this dénouement did not result in any sense of collective guilt among Soviet Jews (p. 345) or among their American apologists. Indeed, 
American Jewish media figures who were blacklisted because of Communist 
affiliations in the 1940s are now heroes, honored by the film industry, praised 
in newspapers, their work exhibited in museums At the same time, the cause 
of Soviet Jews and their ability to emigrate became a critical rallying point for 
American Jewish activist organizations and a defining feature of neoconservatism 
as a Jewish intellectual and political movement. (For example, Richard Perle, 
a key neoconservative, was Senator Henry Jackson’s most important security 
advisor from 1969 to 1979 and organized Congressional support for the JacksonVanik Amendment linking U.S.-Soviet trade to the ability of Jews to emigrate 
from the Soviet Union. The bill was passed over strenuous opposition from 
the Nixon administration.) Jewish activist organizations and many Jewish 
historians portray the Soviet Jewish experience as a sojourn in the land of the 
“Red Pharaohs” (p. 360). The historical legacy is that Jews were the passive, 
uncomprehending victims of the White armies, the Nazis, the Ukrainian 
nationalists, and the postwar Soviet state, nothing more.


THE ISSUE OF JEWISH CULPABILITY

Alexander Solzhenitsyn calls on Jews to accept moral responsibility for the 
Jews who “took part in the iron Bolshevik leadership and, even more so, in the 
ideological guidance of a huge country down a false path.…[and for the Jewish 
role in the] Cheka executions, the drowning of the barges with the condemned 
in the White and Caspian Seas, collectivization, the Ukrainian famine—in all the 
vile acts of the Soviet regime” (quoted on p. 360). But according to Slezkine, there
can be no collective guilt because Soviet violence, unlike the Nazi persecution of 
the Jews, was not tribal violence. Violence of the Soviet sort has “no legitimate 
heirs—for either the victims or the perpetrators” (p. 345). Slezkine acknowledges 
that Jews were “the most enthusiastic ethnically defined supporters of the Soviet 
state” but he essentially argues that Jews were not really Jews when they were 
Communists, at least until World War II caused them to be conscious of their 
Jewish identities. After all, the legacy of Communism “was almost as strongly 
committed to cosmopolitanism as it was to mass violence” (p. 346).

Again we see the importance of Slezkine’s claims that Jewish Communists 
lacked a Jewish identity. However, as demonstrated above, there can be little 
doubt that Soviet Jews thought of themselves as Jews (although they certainly were 
not religious Jews) and that they worked together on the basis of shared Jewish 
ethnic identity. Nevertheless, the critical issue for collective guilt is whether the 
Jewish enthusiasm for the Soviet state and the enthusiastic participation of Jews 
in the violence against what Slezkine terms “rural backwardness and religion” 
(p. 346) had something to do with their Jewish identity. 

This is a more difficult claim to establish, but the outlines of the argument 
are quite clear. Even granting the possibility that the revolutionary vanguard 
composed of Jews like Trotsky that spearheaded the Bolshevik Revolution was 
far more influenced by a universalist utopian vision than by their upbringing 
in traditional Judaism, it does not follow that this was the case for the millions 
of Jews who left the shtetl towns of the Pale of Settlement to migrate to Moscow 
and the urban centers of the new state. The migration of the Jews to the urban 
centers of the USSR is a critical aspect of Slezkine’s presentation, but it strains 
credulity to suppose that these migrants threw off, completely and immediately, 
all remnants of the Eastern European shtetl culture which, Slezkine acknowledges, 
had a deep sense of estrangement from non-Jewish culture, and in particular 
a fear and hatred of peasants resulting from the traditional economic relations 
between Jews and peasants and exacerbated by the long and recent history of 
anti-Jewish pogroms carried out by peasants. Traditional Jewish shtetl culture 
also had a very negative attitude toward Christianity, not only as the central 
cultural icon of the outgroup but as associated in their minds with a long history 
of anti-Jewish persecution. The same situation doubtless occurred in Poland, 
where the efforts of even the most “de-ethnicized” Jewish Communists to recruit 
Poles were inhibited by traditional Jewish attitudes of superiority toward and 
estrangement from traditional Polish culture

In other words, the war against “rural backwardness and religion” was exactly 
the sort of war that a traditional Jew would have supported wholeheartedly, 
because it was a war against everything they hated and thought of as oppressing 
them. Of course traditional shtetl Jews also hated the tsar and his government 
due to restrictions on Jews and because they did not think that the government 
did enough to rein in anti-Jewish violence. There can be little doubt that Lenin’s
contempt for “the thick-skulled, boorish, inert, and bearishly savage Russian or 
Ukrainian peasant” was shared by the vast majority of shtetl Jews prior to the 
Revolution and after it. Those Jews who defiled the holy places of traditional 
Russian culture and published anti-Christian periodicals doubtless reveled in 
their tasks for entirely Jewish reasons, and, as Gorky worried, their activities not 
unreasonably stoked the anti-Semitism of the period. Given the anti-Christian 
attitudes of traditional shtetl Jews, it is very difficult to believe that the Jews 
engaged in campaigns against Christianity did not have a sense of revenge 
against the old culture that they held in such contempt.

Indeed, Slezkine reviews some of the works of early Soviet Jewish writers that 
illustrate the revenge theme. The amorous advances of the Jewish protagonist 
of Eduard Bagritsky’s poem “February” are rebuffed by a Russian girl, but their 
positions are changed after the Revolution when he becomes a deputy commissar. 
Seeing the girl in a brothel, he has sex with her without taking off his boots, his 
gun, or his trench coat—an act of aggression and revenge: 

I am taking you because so timid 
Have I always been, and to take vengeance
For the shame of my exiled forefathers
And the twitter of an unknown fledgling!
I am taking you to wreak my vengeance
On the world I could not get away from!

Slezkine seems comfortable with revenge as a Jewish motive, but he does not 
consider traditional Jewish culture itself to be a contributor to Jewish attitudes 
toward traditional Russia, even though he notes that a very traditional part of 
Jewish culture was to despise the Russians and their culture. (Even the Jewish 
literati despised all of traditional Russian culture, apart from Pushkin and a few 
literary icons.) Indeed, one wonders what would motivate the Jewish commissars 
to revenge apart from motives related to their Jewish identity. Traditional hostility 
toward non-Jews and their culture forms a central theme in the writings of 
Israel Shahak and many mainstream Jewish historians, including Slezkine, and 
I have presented summaries of this material elsewhere An important aspect of 
Slezkine’s general theoretical approach is that relationships between Mercurians 
and Apollonians involve mutual hostility, suspicion and contempt, and a sense 
of superiority (p. 20). These traditional attitudes were exacerbated by the increase 
in tensions between Jews and non-Jews beginning with the pogroms of 1881 and 
extending, with fits and starts, into the period of the Bolshevik Revolution.

Slezkine’s argument that Jews were critically involved in destroying 
traditional Russian institutions, liquidating Russian nationalists, murdering the 
tsar and his family, dispossessing and murdering the kulaks, and destroying 
the Orthodox Church has been made by many other writers over the years, 
including Igor Shafarevich, a mathematician and member of the prestigious 
U. S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS). Shafarevich’s review of Jewish
literary works during the Soviet and post-Soviet period agrees with Slezkine 
in showing Jewish hatred mixed with a powerful desire for revenge toward 
pre-revolutionary Russia and its culture But Shafarevich also suggests that 
the Jewish “Russophobia” that prompted the mass murder is not a unique 
phenomenon, but results from traditional Jewish hostility toward the non-Jewish 
world, considered tref (unclean), and toward non-Jews themselves, considered 
sub-human and as worthy of destruction. Both Shafarevich and Slezkine review 
the traditional animosity of Jews toward Russia, but Slezkine attempts to get his 
readers to believe that shtetl Jews were magically transformed in the instant of 
Revolution; although they did carry out the destruction of traditional Russia and 
approximately twenty million of its people, they did so only out of the highest 
humanitarian motives and the dream of utopian socialism, only to return to an 
overt Jewish identity because of the pressures of World War II, the rise of Israel 
as a source of Jewish identity and pride, and anti-Jewish policies and attitudes 
in the USSR. This is simply not plausible. 

The situation prompts reflection on what might have happened in the United 
States had American Communists and their sympathizers assumed power. The 
“red diaper babies” came from Jewish families which “around the breakfast 
table, day after day, in Scarsdale, Newton, Great Neck, and Beverly Hills have 
discussed what an awful, corrupt, immoral, undemocratic, racist society the 
United States is.”66 Indeed, hatred toward the peoples and cultures of non-Jews 
and the image of enslaved ancestors as victims of anti-Semitism have been the 
Jewish norm throughout history—much commented on, from Tacitus to the 
present

It is easy to imagine which sectors of American society would have been 
deemed overly backward and religious and therefore worthy of mass murder 
by the American counterparts of the Jewish elite in the Soviet Union—the ones 
who journeyed to Ellis Island instead of Moscow. The descendants of these 
overly backward and religious people now loom large among the “red state” 
voters who have been so important in recent national elections. Jewish animosity 
toward the Christian culture that is so deeply ingrained in much of America is 
legendary. As Joel Kotkin points out, “for generations, [American] Jews have 
viewed religious conservatives with a combination of fear and disdain.”68 And 
as Elliott Abrams notes, the American Jewish community “clings to what is 
at bottom a dark vision of America, as a land permeated with anti-Semitism 
and always on the verge of anti-Semitic outbursts.”69 These attitudes are well 
captured in Steven Steinlight’s charge that the Americans who approved 
the immigration restriction legislation of the 1920s—the vast majority of the 
population—were a “thoughtless mob” and that the legislation itself was “evil, 
xenophobic, anti-Semitic,” “vilely discriminatory,” a “vast moral failure,” a 
“monstrous policy.”70 In the end, the dark view of traditional Slavs and their 
culture that facilitated the participation of so many Eastern European shtetl Jews 
in becoming willing executioners in the name of international socialism is not
very different from the views of contemporary American Jews about a majority 
of their fellow countrymen. 

There is a certain enormity in all this. The twentieth century was indeed 
the Jewish century because Jews and Jewish organizations were intimately 
and decisively involved in its most important events. Slezkine’s greatest 
accomplishment is to set the historical record straight on the importance of Jews 
in the Bolshevik Revolution and its aftermath, but he doesn’t focus on the huge 
repercussions of the Revolution, repercussions that continue to shape the world 
of the twenty-first century. In fact, for long after the Revolution, conservatives 
throughout Europe and the United States believed that Jews were responsible 
for Communism and for the Bolshevik Revolution The Jewish role in leftist 
political movements was a common source of anti-Jewish attitudes among a great 
many intellectuals and political figures. In Germany, the identification of Jews 
and Bolshevism was widespread in the middle classes and was a critical part of 
the National Socialist view of the world. As historian Ernst Nolte has noted, for 
middle-class Germans, “the experience of the Bolshevik revolution in Germany 
was so immediate, so close to home, and so disquieting, and statistics seemed 
to prove the overwhelming participation of Jewish ringleaders so irrefutably,” 
that even many liberals believed in Jewish responsibility Jewish involvement 
in the horrors of Communism was also an important sentiment in Hitler’s desire 
to destroy the USSR and in the anti-Jewish actions of the German National 
Socialist government. Jews and Jewish organizations were also important forces 
in inducing the Western democracies to side with Stalin rather than Hitler in 
World War II. 

The victory over National Socialism set the stage for the tremendous increase 
in Jewish power in the post-World War II Western world, in the end more than 
compensating for the decline of Jews in the Soviet Union. As Slezkine shows, the 
children of Jewish immigrants assumed an elite position in the United States, just 
as they had in the Soviet Union and throughout Eastern Europe and Germany 
prior to World War II. This new-found power facilitated the establishment of 
Israel, the transformation of the United States and other Western nations in 
the direction of multiracial, multicultural societies via large-scale non-white 
immigration, and the consequent decline in European demographic and cultural 
preeminence. 73 The critical Jewish role in Communism has been sanitized, while 
Jewish victimization by the Nazis has achieved the status of a moral touchstone 
and is a prime weapon in the push for massive non-European immigration, 
multiculturalism, and advancing other Jewish causes. 
 The Jewish involvement in Bolshevism has therefore had an enormous effect 
on recent European and American history. It is certainly true that Jews would 
have attained elite status in the United States with or without their prominence 
in the Soviet Union. However, without the Soviet Union as a shining beacon of 
a land freed of official anti-Semitism where Jews had attained elite status in a
stunningly short period, the history of the United States would have been very 
different. The persistence of Jewish radicalism influenced the general political 
sensibility of the Jewish community and had a destabilizing effect on American 
society, ranging from the paranoia of the McCarthy era, to the triumph of the 1960s 
countercultural revolution, to the conflicts over immigration and multiculturalism 
that are so much a part of the contemporary political landscape

It is Slezkine’s chief contention that the history of the twentieth century was a 
history of the rise of the Jews in the West, in the Middle East, and in Russia, and 
ultimately their decline in Russia. I think he is absolutely right about this. If there 
is any lesson to be learned, it is that Jews not only became an elite in all these 
areas, they became a hostile elite—hostile to traditional peoples and cultures of all 
three areas they came to dominate. Until now, the greatest human tragedies have 
occurred in the Soviet Union, but Israel’s record as an oppressive and expansive 
occupying power in the Middle East has made it a pariah among the vast majority 
of the governments of the world. And Jewish hostility toward the Europeanderived people and culture of the United States has been a consistent feature of 
Jewish political behavior and attitudes throughout the twentieth century. In the 
present, this normative Jewish hostility toward the traditional population and 
culture of the United States remains a potent motivator of Jewish involvement 
in the transformation of the U.S. into a non-European society

Given this record of Jews as a hostile but very successful elite, I doubt that the 
continued demographic and cultural dominance of Western European peoples 
will be retained either in Europe or the United States and other Western societies 
without a decline in Jewish influence. (Perhaps more obviously, the same might 
be said vis-à-vis the Palestinians and other Arab peoples in the Middle East.) The 
lesson of the Soviet Union (and Spain from the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries) 
is that Jewish influence does wax and wane. Unlike the attitudes of the utopian 
ideologies of the twentieth century, there is no end to history.
